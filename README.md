backend for apps and web tools

Cycle Philly is a smartphone-based project to collect voluntary data on cyclists' bike route preferences.

The goal is to promote the app during a two to four week window where city or regional bicyclists would be encouraged to download and use the app to track their biking habits. The route data would be linked to a webmapping viewer that would allow users to the recorded routes and bike patterns of of all participants in realtime (users get fun instant feedback, we get great—if self-selected—data in the aggregate).

The data generated would supplement the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission's existing demographic data, and help us understand from a network perspective how bicyclists move through the city – and provide another data resource to help prioritize improvements.

The cyclephilly.org web interface is an adaptation of CycleAtlanta's route mapping interface created by Chris LeDantec.
