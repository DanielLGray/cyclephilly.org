        <p id="filterText">Cycle Philly is a smartphone app for recording your bicycle trips. When you use the app, you are giving transportation planners in the City of Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) the data they need to make Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley a better place to ride.</p>
			<p id="filterText">The app uses your phone's GPS record your routes in real-time, allowing planners to know which routes cyclists prefer. The app will also allow users to report problems along their route such as potholes, obstructed bike lanes, etc. The information collected by the app will be used by the City of Philadelphia and DVRPC to make strategic improvements to bicycle infrastructure. This will make cycling in Philadelphia and its surrounding areas more pleasant, and encourage those who currently donâ€™t bike to give it a go.</p>
